Pong AI

Two agents will learn to play pong against each other. This differs from other methods online which have one agent play against a bang-bang ai.

I also have the agents rewarded for hitting the ball; this is to help get the desired behavior quicker whereas online methods only reward for winning the game.

I'm training four algorithms -
    Vanilla Policy Gradients (REINFORCE)
    Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C)
    Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)
    Deep Q Network (DQN)

The first three algorithms use the same underlying principle - Policy Gradients
The policy is the neural network that takes in the environment state and outputs probabilities for actions.
