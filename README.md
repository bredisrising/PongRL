Pong AI

Two agents will learn to play pong against each other. This differs from other methods online which have one agent play against a bang-bang ai.

I also have the agents rewarded for hitting the ball; this is to help get the desired behavior quicker whereas online methods only reward for winning the game. Rewarding for winning a round or game could also hinder performance
